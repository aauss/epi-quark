How to use epi-quark
====================

Installation
------------

Ideally, you should have conda. If so, simply run:

.. code-block:: console

    conda env create -f end-dev.yml

This will create a new environment which produces a new environment named ``epi-quark``. With this, you can run the tests and the code.

You can also look through ``end-dev.yml`` to find the required packages and you may install them manually if you wish.
